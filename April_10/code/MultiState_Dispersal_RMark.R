# ---- 2) Read-in field data -----
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#

# you will need to set working directory to where you saved the 'BorealToad_Dispersal.csv'
setwd()

# read-in the boreal toad capture-mark-recapture data
setwd("G:/Shared drives/wyo-coop-barrile/Boreal_Toad_Project/RS/Population_Modeling_Sp23/Week_9b_MultiState_RMark/data")

# read-in data from the csv
df <- read.csv("BorealToad_Dispersal.csv")

# take a peek at the data
head(df)

# first, order the data frame by Tag and Survey
df <- df %>% arrange(Tag, Survey)
head(df)

# how many ponds did we sample?
n_distinct(df$Pond) # 3 ponds
unique(df$Pond) # A, B, and C

# how many toads did we capture and mark?
n_distinct(df$Tag) # 1129 toads

# how many unique individuals were captured at each pond?
df %>% 
  group_by(Pond) %>% 
  summarise(n=n_distinct(Tag)) %>% 
  rename(Number.of.Individuals=n) %>% 
  data.frame()


# create year variable
# create quick function to extract year from the Date column
RIGHT = function(x,n){
  substring(x,nchar(x)-n+1)
}
# now create year column in df
df$Year <- RIGHT(df$Date, 4)
n_distinct(df$Year) # 5 years
unique(df$Year)

# how many surveys per pond?
df %>% 
  group_by(Pond) %>% 
  summarise(n=n_distinct(Survey)) %>%

# how many surveys per pond per year?
df %>% 
  group_by(Pond, Year) %>% 
  summarise(n=n_distinct(Survey)) %>% 
  rename(Surveys=n) %>% 
  data.frame()


# So, it seems we have capture-mark-recapture data for boreal toads
# at three ponds, and we surveyed each pond for five years (2016-2020).
# However, within each year, we surveyed ponds a different numbers of
# times depending on the year. For instance, we surveyed Pond A 9 times
# in 2016 but only 5 times in 2017, whereas we surveyed Pond B 4 times
# in 2016 and 4 times in 2017. So we'll need to account for this
# disparity by fixing various capture probabilties in RMark

#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#

#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#
# ---- 3) Format data for RMark -----
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#

# first, remove duplicates (if the same individual was captured twice or more during the same survey)
# identify duplicates
df %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Tag, Survey) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  dplyr::filter(n > 1L)

# remove duplicates (we did not have any in this case)
df <- df %>% distinct(Tag, Survey, .keep_all = TRUE)



# next, create capture histories for each individual

# first, reduce dataframe to columns that we need
m <- df %>% select(Tag, Survey, Pond)
# create a numeric variable for pond (need this to pivot values)
m$nPond <- NA
m$nPond[m$Pond == "A"] <- 1
m$nPond[m$Pond == "B"] <- 2
m$nPond[m$Pond == "C"] <- 3
# make Tag a factor variable (possibly unnecessary but probably good practice)
m$Tag <- as.factor(as.character(m$Tag))
# order the data frame by Survey
m <- m %>% arrange(Survey)
# pivot data to wide format
y <- m %>% pivot_wider(id_cols = Tag, names_from = Survey, values_from = nPond, values_fill = 0)
y

# create capture history as character string
y <- y %>% unite("ch", c(2:ncol(.)), remove = FALSE, sep = "")

# reduce dataframe to columns that we need
y <- y %>% select(Tag, ch) %>% data.frame()
head(y)

# substitute A, B, and C for 1, 2, and 3 (respectively) in the capture history
y$ch <- gsub("1","A", y$ch)
y$ch <- gsub("2","B", y$ch)
y$ch <- gsub("3","C", y$ch)
head(y)

# check if all capture histories are length = 15 (for each of our fifteen surveys at each site)
table(nchar(y$ch))

# bt will be our dataframe that we input into RMark
bt <- data.frame(ch = y$ch, 
                 freq = 1, 
                 tag = y$Tag)

# remove unneeded objects
rm(y,m,RIGHT)

# so we have df and bt dataframes
head(df)
head(bt)

# are we missing any data?
table(is.na(bt)) # no missing data = good!

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Check capture histories against our field data
# Look at our first individual
head(df %>% arrange(Tag), 13)
# Does the capture history ('ch' column in tern) make sense for toad 100? 101?
head(bt, 2)
# Stop here and make sure you understand the capture histories (the 'ch' column in bff)
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#
# ---- 4) Fit Multi-State Models in RMark -----
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#

# first, process the data for RMark
# input the model that we want in the 'model =' argument of the process.data function

# here are the list of models in RMark
setup.model(model = "") # 91 models

# As you can see, RMark includes lots of models that can be input into the model= argument below

# Here we use the "HCRDMS" model because we are interested in 
# estimating survival and dispersal, with abundance at each pond as a derived parameter 
# The H in HCRDMS stands for Huggins, which are models that condition abundance out of the likelihood
# such that capture probability can be modeled as a function of individual covariates
# (i.e., these models drop the f0 parameter)
# The C in HCRDMS stands for Closed, meaning that the population is assumed to be closed within primary periods
# The RD in HCRDMS stands for Robust Design
# And finally the MS in HCRDMS stands for Multi-State or Multi-Strata, so we know we are dealing with a model
# that includes multiple states within the capture history

# Visit this link for a full list of MARK models supported in RMark:
# https://github.com/jlaake/RMark/blob/master/RMark/inst/MarkModels.pdf

# specify time intervals for Robust Design
intervals <- c(
  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1, # 2016
  0,0,0,0,0,1,       # 2017
  0,0,0,0,0,1,       # 2018
  0,0,0,0,1,         # 2019
  0,0)               # 2020

intervals

# now, process data in RMark format
d.proc=process.data(bt, 
                    model="HCRDMS",
                    time.intervals=intervals, 
                    begin.time = 2016)

# now create design data from the processed data
d.ddl <- make.design.data(d.proc)
# NOTE: the design dataframes are just as important as your raw data!

# Let's explore the design data
# see which parameters are estimated in the model
names(d.ddl)

d.ddl$S # survival probability

d.ddl$Psi # transition probability
# Psi represents the probability of transitioning between states

d.ddl$p # capture probability

d.ddl$c # recapture probability


# Some notes on our multi-state model

# 'States' in our models refer to individual breeding ponds and
# transition probabilities represent the probability of moving from
# one breeding site to another between seasons.

# This modeling approach assumes that no site transitions occurred
# within a breeding season

# In model parameterization, transition probability is conditional
# on survival (e.g. transition probability Psi(rst) represents the probability
# an individual in state r at time t survives and moves to state s at time t + 1).

# look at transitions in raw capture histories

# within years
