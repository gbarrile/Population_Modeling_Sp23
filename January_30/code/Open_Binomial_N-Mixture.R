# ---- 4) Fit Open Binomial N-mixture model -----
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#

# Here are the meanings of each parameter within the model-fitting function:

# lambdaformula = initial abundance

# gammaformula = recruitment rate (when dynamics is "constant", "autoreg", or "notrend") 
#                OR population growth rate (when dynamics is "trend", "ricker", or "gompertz")

# omegaformula = apparent survival probability (when dynamics is "constant", "autoreg", or "notrend") 
#                OR equilibrium abundance (i.e. carrying capacity) (when dynamics is "ricker" or "gompertz")

# pformula = detection probability

# data = An object of class unmarkedFramePCO.

# mixture = character specifying mixture: "P", "NB", or "ZIP" 
            # for the Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated Poisson distributions.

# K = Integer defining upper bound of discrete integration. 
      #This should be higher than the maximum observed count and high enough 
      #that it does not affect the parameter estimates. However, the higher 
      #the value the slower the compuatation.

# dynamics = see help page

# fix = If "omega", omega is fixed at 1. If "gamma", gamma is fixed at 0.

# starts = vector of starting values

# immigration = logical specifying whether or not to include an 
                # immigration term (iota) in population dynamics.

# iotaformula = Right-hand sided formula for average number of immigrants to a site per time step


# Let's fit the model
